Steps to Run .ipynb:
- On Google Drive, move the 'Dataset' folder from 'Shared with Me' to 'My Drive' (this may be done by dragging and dropping. It may create a shortcut instead of moving. Both are okay.)
- Open the file on Google Colab
- Run all cells
- Provide permission to access your Google Drive when permission is requested
