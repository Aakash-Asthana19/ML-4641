The final project's code is split over two Python notebooks for supervised and unsupervised learning models, respectively. They are: 
CS4641_Project_Supervised.ipynb and CS4641_Project_Unsupervised.ipynb

Steps to Run CS4641_Project_Supervised.ipynb (/src/CS4641_Project_Supervised.ipynb/) or CS4641_Project_Unsupervised.ipynb (/src/CS4641_Project_Unsupervised.ipynb/):
- On Google Drive, move the 'Dataset' folder from 'Shared with Me' to 'My Drive' (this may be done by dragging and dropping. It may create a shortcut instead of moving. Both are okay.)
- Open the file on Google Colab
- Run all cells
- Provide permission to access your Google Drive when permission is requested
